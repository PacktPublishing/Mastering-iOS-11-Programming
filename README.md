# Mastering iOS 11 Programming - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Mastering iOS 11 Programming - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-ios-11-programming-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788398237), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
When Apple launched Swift in 2014, the iOS ecosystem became more accessible than it had ever been for developers. Being able to write apps with Swift's beautiful, readable, and straightforward syntax instead of having to write clunky Objective-C code suddenly enabled a lot of people to play around with iOS development. For me, Swift sparked a renewed interest in developing iOS applications, and the new passion has remained ever since.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
func doSomething(completionHandler: Int -> Void) {
 // perform some actions
 var resultingValue = theResultOfSomeAction()
 completionHandler(resultingValue)
}
```

All the code samples are written in Swift 4.0 with Xcode 9; you'll need a Mac that can run Xcode 9. In order to test all of the code samples in this book, you'll need an iOS device that runs iOS 11 and a payed subscription to Apple's developer program.
